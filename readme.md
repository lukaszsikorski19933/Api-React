# Spring API BOOK
> It's a beloved writing back-book to the REST Method directory.
> To use the API, I used the MVC spring, Jackson's library, and additional annotations.
> I used the curl program to verify our api.
> The division of the application on the backend and frontend layers is very high quality.
> My API client can be a mobile application, frontend application, or other backend application.
